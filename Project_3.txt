Q1) The five wikipedia pages that were visited most often are:
"Database"
"Data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAAuCAIAAABmjeQ9AAAARElEQVR42mVO2wrAUAhy/f8fz%2BniVMTYQ3hLKkgGgN/IPvgIhUYYV/qogdP75J01V%2BJwrKZr/5YPcnzN3e6t7l%2B2K%2BEFX91B1daOi7sAAAAASUVORK5CYII%3D"
"Data"
"Data_mining"
"Data_Protection_Act_1998"

Q2) The create statement for the table is as follows:
CREATE TABLE wikistats(
    projectcode VARCHAR (1024) NOT NULL,
    pagename VARCHAR (1024) NOT NULL,
    pageviews NUMERIC NOT NULL,
    bytes NUMERIC NOT NULL
);

I could have put a unique constraint on the pagename field.

Q3)The SQL statement to show the five most visited wikipedia pages is as follows:
select projectcode, pagename, sum(pageviews) as pagecount from wikistats group by projectcode, 
pagename order by sum(pageviews) desc LIMIT 5;
